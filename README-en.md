# dsh-plugin-notify

Message reminders for the DeepSeek Harness web GUI: browser, system, webhook
(Feishu/DingTalk/WeCom/generic JSON) and sound notifications when a task turn finishes or
execution waits for user confirmation, plus a settings section to manage channels.

## Channels

| Channel | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser notification (in-page banner) + optional OS notification | Client | Two independent settings. **Browser notification** shows a text banner in the top-right while the page is visible. **OS notification** uses the browser Notification API, so it also fires when the tab is in the background or the window is minimized (browser notification permission required). Keep the browser running and use the host system channel if you leave the page entirely. |
| System notification | Host | macOS `osascript` / Linux `notify-send` / Windows PowerShell native toast (Windows 10/11 action center); works even when the browser is closed. Optional system sound (macOS `afplay` / Windows built-in alert sound). Can be pointed at any notifier command via [`system.notifier`](#custom-notifier-systemnotifier). |
| Feishu group bot | Host | Text message, optional signed secret (timestamp + HMAC-SHA256), optional custom message template. |
| DingTalk group bot | Host | Text message, optional signed secret (timestamp + sign), optional custom message template. |
| WeCom group bot | Host | Text message, optional custom message template. |
| Generic webhook | Host | Custom URL + headers + JSON/text template. Placeholders: `{{title}} {{body}} {{kind}} {{sessionId}} {{turn}} {{toolName}} {{reason}} {{time}}`. Works with Slack / Discord / ntfy / Bark / ServerChan / PushPlus, etc. |

## Custom notifier (`system.notifier`)

The host channel calls the operating system's own notification command by default. In some
environments that **fails silently** — most notably on macOS, where the identity behind
`osascript display notification` is taken from the host app up the launch chain. If that app
never asked for notification permission, macOS drops the notification while `osascript` still
exits `0`, so the plugin has no way to notice.

`system.notifier` is the escape hatch: set `command` and it is used instead, with `{{title}}` /
`{{body}}` interpolated into `args` (the same template shape the webhook channels use).

```yaml
- id: dsh-plugin-notify
  config:
    system:
      enabled: true
      notifier:
        command: /opt/homebrew/bin/terminal-notifier
        args: ["-title", "{{title}}", "-message", "{{body}}"]
```

An empty `command` keeps the OS default (and is the default value), so behaviour is unchanged
unless you opt in.

Unlike the OS default commands, **a real notifier reports real exit codes** (terminal-notifier
uses `3` for "not authorized"), so a failed delivery surfaces as a warning in the plugin log
instead of a silent success.

## Message format

All webhook channels share the same placeholders:
`{{title}} {{body}} {{kind}} {{sessionId}} {{turn}} {{toolName}} {{reason}} {{time}}`.

- Feishu/DingTalk/WeCom use a unified default format (title + details + session + local time).
  Leave the **Message template** field empty in settings to use the default; fill it to render
  with your own template.
- The generic webhook sends the plain-text message body when its template is empty.

## Triggers

- `turn/end`: fired when a turn ends, filtered by `triggers.turnEndKinds`
  (completed/blocked/aborted/error; default completed+blocked).
- `approval/asked`: fired when a tool call waits for user approval (host channels).
- `tool/call` (with `name` `ask_user_question`): fired when the model asks the
  user a question through the interactive question tool (host channels).
- The browser channel additionally covers interactions waiting for user confirmation
  (approval / question, from the pending list in the session snapshot).

Host system/webhook channels cover all sessions; the browser channel follows the currently
open session.

## Install

Install into the web profile from GitHub (requires `pnpm` on `PATH`; otherwise use the
corepack fallback below):

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add "github:c-ling/dsh-plugin-notify#v1.3.0"
```

Or with an existing `dsh` binary:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:c-ling/dsh-plugin-notify#v1.3.0"
```

When `pnpm` is not on `PATH`:

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
corepack pnpm add "github:c-ling/dsh-plugin-notify#v1.3.0"
```

> `dsh plugin` forwards its arguments to pnpm and fetches the package from this repo
> (pnpm 9+, `git` required). The warning
> `declares no dsh.bundle — installed as a plain dependency` is expected: this plugin is
> not a profile bundle layer; it is activated by the loader row below.

Then add a loader row to `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: notify
      name: 'dsh-plugin-notify'
```

Restart `dsh web` (client-modules caches package verdicts per process; new packages require a
host restart), then hard-refresh the page. The settings page appears under
**Settings → Message reminders**.

## Verify

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3080/plugins/dsh-plugin-notify/client.js | head -c 60
```

It should print a factory bundle starting with `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({`; in
**Settings → Message reminders** you can configure each channel and send a test message.

## Update

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:c-ling/dsh-plugin-notify#v1.3.0"
# or: npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add "github:c-ling/dsh-plugin-notify#v1.3.0"
# or: cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web && corepack pnpm add "github:c-ling/dsh-plugin-notify#v1.3.0"
```

Re-running the install command with the new `#v1.3.0` pin upgrades the dependency;
the loader row in `cordis.patch.yml` stays unchanged. Restart `dsh web`, then hard-refresh.

## Uninstall

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
corepack pnpm remove dsh-plugin-notify   # or: dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-plugin-notify
```

Also remove the matching `insert` row from `cordis.patch.yml`, then restart `dsh web`.
Configuration lives in the Harness settings document `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` under the
`dsh-plugin-notify:` namespace (fallback storage under `$DSH_HOME/storages/dsh-plugin-notify/`);
delete that section and directory to remove it completely.

## Config storage

Since v1.3.0 the config is stored through the official Harness settings service when one is
mounted: it persists into `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` under `dsh-plugin-notify:` (registered via
`installSettingsSection` on the host, reactively mirrored on the browser via `settingsScope`).
Without a settings provider the plugin falls back to the classic store
`$DSH_HOME/storages/dsh-plugin-notify/config.json` (overridable via `config.directory`). The
first start after upgrading seeds the base layer from an existing config.json, so no manual
migration is needed.

Feishu/DingTalk signature secrets are schema-declared write-only `role('secret')` fields: the
settings document and every wire surface only expose a "configured" marker, never the plaintext.
The API reads them back as empty strings and marks configured ones with `secretSet`; an empty
string on write means "keep unchanged", and `clearSecrets` lists paths to clear. Webhook URLs and
generic request headers are stored in plain text, so do not put sensitive credentials there
(other than the Feishu/DingTalk signature secrets).

### API access control

All three `/dsh-plugin-notify/*` routes sit behind a **trust fence** that defends the two
confused-deputy paths a browser opens against a local HTTP API:

- **DNS rebinding** — `Host` names the attacker's domain while the socket lands on this server.
- **Cross-site requests** — a malicious page writing to the local API directly.

This API is a *write* surface (`system.notifier.command` is executed), so neither path is
acceptable. The fence binds browser and non-browser clients alike: over plain HTTP a browser may
send neither `Origin` nor Fetch metadata, so `Host` is the only always-reliable signal.

Loopback (`localhost` / `::1` / `127.x.x.x`) is trusted by default. When the deployment is served
over a LAN, a tunnel or a reverse proxy, add its authority (exact `host:port`) to
`security.trustedHosts`:

```yaml
- id: dsh-plugin-notify
  config:
    security:
      trustedHosts: ["dsh.example:3443"]
```

Unset, the behaviour is loopback-only. DSH applies the same design to its `/api` bridge
(`isTrustedApiRequest` in `dsh-client-connection`), but routes registered through
`webServer.register` do **not** inherit it, so the plugin carries its own.

## Development

```sh
node --check lib/index.js lib/client.js
node --test
```

The client is a hand-written factory-CJS bundle
(`window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id: "dsh-plugin-notify", factory })`) with no build step;
its UI is registered through the `settings.section` and `shell.overlay` slots. The host half
imports `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings` / `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` lazily and optionally (it falls
back to config.json whenever the packages are unresolvable or no settings provider is mounted),
registers three routes on the `webServer` service, and subscribes to the `session/event` stream.

Endpoints:

- `GET  /dsh-plugin-notify/config` — sanitized current config + `secretSet`
- `POST /dsh-plugin-notify/config` — `{ config, clearSecrets? }` replaces the user-editable config
- `POST /dsh-plugin-notify/test` — `{ channel: "system" | "feishu" | "dingtalk" | "wecom" | "generic", genericId? }` sends a test message

## Changelog

- **v1.3.0** — Adapt to DeepSeek Harness 0.1.1 (migration A): the config now persists through
  the official settings document `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` (`installSettingsSection` +
  reactive `settingsScope` reads); an existing config.json is migrated automatically as the
  base layer, and the classic store remains the fallback without a settings provider. Feishu/
  DingTalk signature secrets are schema-declared write-only `role('secret')` fields — no
  plaintext on the settings document or any wire surface. External config changes (another tab,
  a hand-edited settings.yaml) now take effect live in the browser.
- **v1.2.0** — Host channels now support `ask_user_question` notifications: when the model
  calls `ask_user_question`, the system channel and Feishu/DingTalk/WeCom/generic webhooks
  send a "waiting for answer" reminder. Also fixed browser native notifications only
  showing the first pending notification because of a fixed notification tag.
- **v1.1.3** — Normalize the README structure: the default `README.md` is now Chinese and
  the English doc moved to `README-en.md` (`README-ZH.md` removed); every install command is
  pinned to `#v1.1.3`.
- **v1.1.2** — Split the README into default English `README.md` + Chinese `README-ZH.md`
  (reciprocal language links at the top), add the `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin ...` install
  path and an Update section, and pin every install command to `#v1.1.2`.
- **v1.1.1** — Fix dark-mode styling for the **Settings → Message reminders** page: save
  button, switches, card/input borders and status colors now use `--dsw-alias-*` design
  tokens and follow the light/dark theme.
- **v1.1.0** — Add browser OS notifications, Windows system notifications and alert sounds;
  browser and OS notifications are now independent settings.
- **v1.0.0** — First GitHub release: browser banner, system notification,
  Feishu/DingTalk/WeCom/generic webhook channels, and the settings page.

## Known limitations

- The browser channel is an in-page text banner by default. When **OS notification** is
  enabled, the browser Notification API can notify while the tab is in the background or the
  window is minimized (permission required, and the browser must stay running). Use the host
  system notification channel when the browser is fully closed.
- Host system notifications depend on the notification identity of the process running
  `dsh web`. On macOS that identity is inherited from the host app up the launch chain
  (terminal / launcher): if it never asked for notification permission (Ghostty, for example,
  defaults `app-notifications` to `never`), or `dsh web` is started by launchd with no GUI
  session, `osascript` is dropped silently and still exits `0`. Point
  [`system.notifier`](#custom-notifier-systemnotifier) at a notifier that carries its own
  identity instead.
- Feishu/DingTalk signature secrets are write-only + read-sanitized and stored unencrypted in
  the local `settings.yaml` (or the fallback `config.json`); do not put other sensitive
  credentials in generic-webhook URLs or request headers.
